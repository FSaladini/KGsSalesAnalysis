# KGsSalesAnalysis
This is a project following Keith Gallil's video on how to do a sales analysis

- Link to Keith's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4
- GitHub code and data: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks



The reason behind this GitHub repository is to:

1. Study the ETL cycle using python and Jupyter notebooks for the analysis
2. Learn how to use the basics of GitHub
3. Train creating some basic graphs for the analysis



Throughout we have the following steps:

1. Loading the data
2. Uniting the data into one csv file
3. Creating some new columns
4. Using some data manipulation and matplotlib graphs to answer business questions
